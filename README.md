## The following task has been implemented:

Create a Java application that will interact with a database using JDBC. Your task is to implement a bank account management system that supports transactions.

Requirements
Database setup:
Create a table accounts with fields:
id (PRIMARY KEY, BIGSERIAL)
account_number (VARCHAR)
balance (DECIMAL)

Application functions:
Create account: Method to add a new account with an initial balance.
View balance: Method to get the current balance by account number.
Transfer funds: Method to transfer funds from one account to another. This method must be implemented as a transaction to ensure data integrity.
Transactions:

Implement the transfer of funds between two accounts as a transaction. If the transfer cannot be completed (for example, insufficient funds), the transaction must be rolled back.
Error handling:

Handle possible exceptions such as insufficient funds for the transfer, and ensure that the transaction is rolled back in case of an error.
Testing:

Additional task
Implement logging of transactions in a separate table transactions, where information about each transfer will be stored: transaction_id, from_account, to_account, amount, timestamp.
